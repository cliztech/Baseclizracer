# Product Vision

## Mission
Create an Outrun-style pseudo-3D racing game in HTML5 and Javascript that serves as a robust tech demo and foundation for multiplayer, web3-enhanced gameplay.

## Non-Negotiables
- Speed is a feature: 60fps on desktop.
- Clarity beats cleverness: Code should be readable and modular.
- State over conversation: Source of truth is in the code and `.context/` files.

## User Outcomes
- [ ] User can play a smooth racing game in the browser without plugins.
- [ ] User can customize game settings (resolution, lanes, road width) via UI.
- [ ] Developer can easily extend the game with new assets, multiplayer logic, or web3 hooks.
