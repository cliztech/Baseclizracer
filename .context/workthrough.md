# Workthrough Log

## 2025-01-28 - System Bootstrapping
**Objective:** Establish `.context/` architecture.
**Approach:** Created `gemini.md` (Identity), `plan.md` (State), `lsp.md` (Constraints).
**Observation:** The repository is a hybrid of legacy `common.js` and modern `*.mjs`. This "schizophrenia" is a prime candidate for future refactoring.
**Outcome:** Context established. Reality Distortion Field active.
